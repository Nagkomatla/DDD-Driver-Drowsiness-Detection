# DDD-Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
🚨 Driver Drowsiness Detection – Version 1.0 😴 A real-time driver drowsiness detection system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Python to enhance driver safety by monitoring eye closure and alerting when drowsiness is detected.
## Have you ever felt drowsy while driving? 
## I built a simple driver drowsiness detection system  that uses computer vision to track blink counts and detect prolonged eye closure, triggering an alert! 
## When you’re too tired, the system triggers an alert🚨 to keep you safe.



## ✅ Features:
## 🔹Face detection
## 🔹 Accurate eye closure detection
## 🔹 Blink counting
## 🔹 Audio alert (with my own voice!🤠📣)🚨
## 🔹 Progress bar for real-time warning

## 🛠  Used: 
## 🔸 OpenCV  & MediaPipe  for face and eye detection
## 🔸 Python for full implementation

## 📌 What do you think? What features should I add next to make it even better?
# ----------------------------------------
# 📝 How It Works?
# The system tracks eye aspect ratio (EAR) and detects drowsiness based on eye closure duration:

# 1. Detects eyes using MediaPipe.

# 2. Calculates EAR to check if the eyes are closed.

# 3. If the eyes remain closed for a certain period, a voice alert is triggered.


# 🤔 Future Improvements:

# 🔹 Yawning detection

# 🔹 Sending alerts via Telegram

# 🔹 Mobile App Integration
